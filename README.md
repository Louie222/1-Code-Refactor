This is my Code Refactor assignment. In this assignment the HTML document was made up of several div elements. I had to use HTML semantics (nav, article, main) as alternatives without the page have any issues.

Some of the elements inside the HTML document shared the same properties and values as one another. 

The elements that were mutual in properties and values, the CSS stylesheet linked had their own line of code to show this.

To reduce the length of the stylesheet, I put these elements on the same line.
